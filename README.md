# Virtual Art Gallery

Virtual Art Gallery is a Java-based desktop application created with Swing for the graphical interface and MySQL as the database management system. This project is designed for showcasing and managing an art gallery's digital exhibits.

## Features
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built using Java Swing for a smooth and interactive user experience.
- **Database Integration**: All artwork, user, and gallery data is stored and managed in a MySQL database.
- **API Integration**: Some APIs are used in this project to enhance functionality.

## Requirements
- **Java**: Ensure Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your system.
- **NetBeans IDE**: Developed and tested in NetBeans; you may use other IDEs, but paths may vary.
- **MySQL Database**: Install and configure MySQL; create the necessary tables in your database.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine.

### 2. Configure Resource Paths
Ensure all image files and resources are placed in the correct file paths as per your local setup:
   - Update paths in the code to match your local directory structure where image files or other resources are stored.
   
### 3. Set Up API Keys
Some functionalities require external APIs. Make sure to:
   - Obtain API keys for any services used.
   - Replace placeholder API keys in the code with your actual keys.

### 4. Create MySQL Database and Tables
   - Open MySQL and create a new database for the project.
   - Import or define the required tables for storing gallery information, user details, artwork metadata, etc.
   - Update your database credentials in the code if necessary.

### 5. Compile and Run
Open the project in NetBeans IDE and run it. Verify that all paths and database connections are correctly configured.

### Troubleshooting
1. **Resource Path Errors**: Check that all file paths for images and other resources are correctly set up.
2. **API Errors**: Make sure API keys are valid and the required APIs are active.
3. **Database Connectivity Issues**: Verify that the MySQL database is running and that your credentials are correctly set.
